                        Practicing orthodontics has meant so much to me because creating a beatiful smile has such a positive impact on my patients' lives. I love to see the changes in my patients personality from the time they walk through the door for their very first visit, being apprehensive and afraid to smile, to the day their braces are removed. They are more confident, have increased self esteem, and can&#45;t wait to show the world their beautiful new smile. 
                        <h3 class="doctor-bio-header">Experience</h3>
                        I am an active member of the teaching staff at Albert Einstein Medical Center&#39;s Department of Dental Medicine, where I teach orthodontic practice and theory to graduate orthodontic residents. Through my experience in general dentistry, teaching orthodontics, and love of continuing education, I am able to offer my patients the most modern up-to-date approach to their care. 
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        I have been a Certified Invisalign&#174; Provider for many years and have incorporated this technology in order to give my patients an alternative to fixed, traditional braces. I have also added laser technology to my practice, which allows me to perform many simple orthodontic procedures comfortably and conveniently, and I am certified by the World Clinical Laser Institute in soft tissue surgical and periodontal applications.
