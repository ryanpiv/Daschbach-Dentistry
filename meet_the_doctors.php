                        Practicing orthodontics has meant so much to me because creating a beatiful smile has such a positive impact on my patients' lives. I love to see the changes in my patients personality from the time they walk through the door for their very first visit, being apprehensive and afraid to smile, to the day their braces are removed. They are more confident, have increased self esteem, and can&#45;t wait to show the world their beautiful new smile.

                        I am a native of Harvey's Lake in northeast Pennsylvania and have lived in Doylestown since 1996. I enjoy spending time outdoors and love to ski. I have recently started cross-country skiing and I am training for my next triathalon. I also enjoy going to Phillies and Eagles games to root for the home team.
